Look for white or blue areas (the full color scale is shown on the bottom right of the screen). The thermal quality takes into account the soaring layer depth, the ground warming, and the average wind speed within the boundary layer. Deep soaring layer, strong ground warming, and low wind speeds increase the value of this indicator.",
  "helpLayerWind": "The wind direction is shown with an arrow. The wind flows in the direction of the arrow. For instance, an arrow that points to the right means that the wind comes from west and goes to east. The wind speed is show in km/h next to the arrow.

  "helpLayerSoaringLayerDepth2": "is the area of the atmosphere where we can expect to find thermals and soar. The depth of the boundary layer tells us how high we can soar. For instance, a value of 850 m means that we can soar up to 850 m above the ground level. Values higher than 750 m are preferable to fly cross-country.",
  "helpLayerSoaringLayerDepth3": "In presence of cumulus clouds, we cap the boundary layer depth to the cloud base. For instance, if the boundary layer depth is 1500 m but the cumulus cloud base is at 1200 m above the ground level, we will show a boundary layer depth of 1200 m.",

  "helpMeteogramWindBarbs": "The wind is shown by wind barbs. The number of barb “flags”, in the arrow, indicates the speed with a precision of 2.5 km/h. For instance, an arrow with a single short flag indicate a speed between 0 and 2.5 km/h. If it has two short flags, it means a speed between 2.5 and 5 km/h. Two long flags mean a speed between 7.5 and 10 km/h. Four long flags mean a speed between 17.5 and 20 km/h, and so on. Alternatively, you can show the wind speed as a numerical value by going to the Settings from the top-left main menu.",

  "helpMeteogramCumulus3": "Soaring pilots can not fly higher than the cloud base. When there is no cloud picture at all, it means there will be “blue thermals”. The presence of cumulus clouds is a good thing to fly cross-country, but if they develop too high they can produce showers or thunderstorms.",
  "helpMeteogramCloudCover": "The cloud cover at various elevation levels is shown by the gray strips: the wider the strip, the more the cloud cover. If the strip takes half of the column, it means a cloud cover of 50%. If it takes the whole column, it means a cloud cover of 100%. Note that the high-level cloud cover is indicated at the topmost part of the diagram (when the vertical scale axis becomes discontinued). In our example, the sky will be quite cloudy the first day, especially at midday. The second day, there will be cumulus clouds. The third day, there will be few cumulus clouds, but cirrus clouds will come in the afternoon.",
